Thats it for now. Pretty much everything gameplay related was made by [iSmileZ](https://twitter.com/SZskins).  
Personalization stuff was made or implemented by myself(i.e. scorebar, input keys, trolldespair).  
Pretty much all of the cursors used are made by myself(I made some big ass cursorpack which I might release in the future.).  
The 404 style cursors are made by iSmileZ tho.  
The base skin was made by [Redo aka -Sc4rYSaiyajin-](https://twitter.com/R3do_) and belongs to [Eternum](https://www.twitch.tv/eternum). Make sure to join his [Discord](https://discord.gg/Cf6SrMh).
